## Previous Events

During the summer of 2020, that is during the Covid-19 pandemic and under lockdown, we managed an international Datathon and Hackathon, focusing on antisemitic tweets and the development of corpora and machine learning algorithms to classify and label hate-speech and antisemitic content.

Here are some articles and resources that document this project the the current outcomes:
