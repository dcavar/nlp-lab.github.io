## Welcome to The NLP Lab Pages

The Natural Language Processing Lab (NLP-Lab) is focused on theoretical work and implementations of [Natural Language Processing] ([NLP]) and [Artificial Intelligence] ([AI]) solutions using hybrid approaches, empiricist, neural, probabilistic, and knowledge-driven, with a particular interest in neuro-symbolic modeling. We are also interested in [Quantum NLP and AI](https://nlp-lab.org/quantumnlp/) and [NLP] combined with Machine Learning ([ML]) solutions for computer vision and multi-modal information processing.

The NLP-Lab is located at [Indiana University at Bloomington](https://iu.edu/). While it is mainly a local group of students and researchers with a strong interest in [NLP] and [AI] here in Indiana, it has ties to colleagues all across the country.

**During the Spring 2025 semester, we meet in person every week in Luddy Hall (BLIF) 0002, every Thursday from 5:00 to 6:30 PM. (See Teams and email announcements for more details.)**

**[The Quantum AI and NLP Study Group](https://nlp-lab.org/quantumnlp/) meetings are in Luddy Hall (BLIF) 0002 every Friday from 4:00 to 5:30 PM.**

**Please contact [Damir Cavar] if you are interested in joining the NLP-Lab meetings.**

## Research Foci

During the 2025 academic year, the focus is on:

- [Quantum NLP](/quantumnlp)
- [Ontology Learning](/ontology_learning): Learning higher level semantic properties from raw text and images
- [Large Language Models (LLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Knowledge Graphs: extraction and visualization from relational databases, unstructured text, and images/videos](/kgextraction)
- Entailment and Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs (and Description Logic/Semantic Web): Using Temporal Graph Neural Networks, Large Language Models, and Knowledge Graphs.
- [Ellipsis and Empty Element Parsing](/ellipsis)
- [Discontinuity and Non-local Dependency Processing in Natural Language Discourse](/discontinuities)
- [Time and Event Annotation and NLP Technologies (TIE-ML)](/timeevents)

In all these projects, we work on hands-on implementation of technologies, utilizing programming languages like [Python] and [Rust], and graph or RDF libraries, as well as common graph-database systems like [Apache Jena], [Fluree], [oxigraph], [AllegroGraph], [GraphDB], or [Neo4j].

See for example:

- [NLP-Lab's Rust material](/rust)
- [NLP-Lab's Python material](/software)

If you are interested in joining our [Rust] tutorials with a focus on using [Rust] for [NLP] and [AI] or in Robotics environments (with the [Robot Operating System] ([ROS])), please get in touch!


Previous projects foci:

- [2023 Datathon and Hackathon](https://isca.indiana.edu/publication-research/social-media-project/datathon-2023/index.html) on Antisemitic and hate speech, using NLP and Machine Learning to process social media posts.
- [Language Resources for Turkic Languages](/turkic) - [Focusing on Azerbaijani](/turkic)
- Processing of the Mueller Report: corpus analysis, prediction models, Knowledge Graph and Event Graph extraction, time reference and sequencing along the time axis ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/SemiringInc/Mueller-Report-Corpus)). The cleaned-out text corpus with basic annotations is finally available. More data is coming soon.
- [Antisemitism in Social Media](/antisemitism)
- [I was](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damircavar/) organizing special meetings to refresh our knowledge of Lisp and Prolog for logic computation and reasoning, in particular, related to computational semantics and pragmatics, and probabilistic logic, integrating Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph technologies. See [here](http://damir.cavar.me/2020-01-23-Knowledge_Representation_and_Reasoning_for_AI_using_Lisp_Prolog)... but the pandemic interfered with that. We should talk about a continuation. Please get in touch, if you are interested in Lisp / Scheme / Prolog.
