## Welcome to The NLP Lab Pages

The Natural Language Processing Lab (NLP-Lab) is focused on theoretical work and implementations of [Natural Language Processing] ([NLP]) and [Artificial Intelligence] ([AI]) solutions using hybrid approaches, empiricist, neural, probabilistic, and knowledge-driven, with a particular interest in neuro-symbolic modeling. We are also interested in [Quantum NLP and AI](https://nlp-lab.org/quantumnlp/) and [NLP] combined with Machine Learning ([ML]) solutions for computer vision and multi-modal information processing. Ultimately, we believe we are getting closer to what [Steve Jobs had as a vision in 1985](https://youtu.be/yolkEfuUaGs).


The NLP-Lab is located at [Indiana University at Bloomington](https://iu.edu/). While it is mainly a local group of students and researchers with a strong interest in [NLP] and [AI] here in Indiana, it has ties to colleagues all across the country.

**During the Fall of 2025, we meet in person every week in Luddy Hall (BLIF) 0002, every Wednesday from 5:30 to 7:00 PM. (See Teams and email announcements for more details.)**

**[The Quantum AI and NLP Study Group](https://nlp-lab.org/quantumnlp/) meetings are in Luddy Hall (BLIF) 0002 every Thursday from 5:30 to 7:00 PM.**

**Please contact [Damir Cavar] if you are interested in joining the NLP-Lab meetings.**
