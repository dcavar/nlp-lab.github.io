## Welcome to The NLP Lab Pages

The NLP-Lab is about this simple fact:

*You cannot train yourself a car. You cannot machine-learn a tire for it. You have to engineer it.*

We do train models, but we actually build and engineer systems. If we know something about language in general or a language in particular, we enjoy using this knowledge in engineering of NLP and AI technologies.


The NLP Lab is located at Indiana University. We use Slack for communication and we meet about 3 to 4 times a week on campus at IU Bloomington.
