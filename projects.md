# Projects


## Quantum AI and NLP

- [Project page](/quantumnlp)


## Ontology Learning

- [Project page](/ontology_learning)


## Substance Abuse Knowledge and AI Systems

This is a joint project with Danny Valdez from Public Health at IU:

- [Substance Abuse Knowledge and AI Systems](/substanceabuse): NIDA Drug Ontology, and substance abuse and slang in social media project.


## Agentive AI, LLMs, RAGs, Ontologies, Knowledge Graphs

- [Large Language Models (LLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Ontologies, and Knowledge Graphs for Agentive AI: extraction and visualization from relational databases, unstructured text, and images/videos](/kgextraction)

- Entailment and Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs (and Description Logic/Semantic Web): Using Temporal Graph Neural Networks, Large Language Models, and Knowledge Graphs.




## Time and Event Annotation

Our proposed annotation standard for time, events, and temporal relations (sequencing and duration) differs from various existing standards in its simplicity and efficiency, both for annotators and machine learning approaches.

- [Project Page](/timeevents)


## Knowledge Graphs

The main Knowedge Graph related project that we are engaged in currently is:

- Unstructured Information to High-quality Knowledge Graph Mapping
- Mapping of Relational Databases to High-quality Knowledge Graphs using R2RML and RML, as well as JRML
- Linking of Large Heterogenous Knowledge Graphs for cross-domain and common sense Reasoning
- Temporal Graph Neural Networks for event and temporal logic modeling (see also Tie-ML)

There are various sub-projects related to this goal and some code repos are available on GitHub.

- [JSON-NLP Schema](https://github.com/SemiringInc/JSON-NLP)
- Open Information Extraction (OpenIE)
- [High Performance NLP](http://hpnlp.org/)
- Free Linguistic Environment
- JSON Probabilistic Unifier (C++, Python, Java, Rust)
- [NLP RESTful Microservices](https://api.linguistic.technology/) (Java, Python, Rust) requires credentials, contact us
- Hoosier Semantic Information ExtractoR (HOOSIER)
- Food and Nutrients AI related to Health Knowledge Graphs


## Turkic Language Resources

We are interested in corpora, NLP technologies, and Knowledge Representations for the following languages:

- Azerbaijani
- Uzbek


## Information Retrieval from Medical Reports

- Mental Health NER and general NLP technologies in Medical and Health applications
- Food and Nutrients Knowledge Graphs related to Knowledge and Semantics technologies


## Antisemitism and Hate-Speech in Social Media

During the summer of 2020 we engaged in an international Datathon and Hackathon on focusing on antisemitic tweets and the development of corpora and machine learning algorithms to classify tweets as antisemitic or not. See the [project page](/antisemitism) for more information on this project.

## Previous projects foci:

- [Ellipsis and Empty Element Parsing](/ellipsis)
- [Discontinuity and Non-local Dependency Processing in Natural Language Discourse](/discontinuities)
- [Time and Event Annotation and NLP Technologies (TIE-ML)](/timeevents)
- [2023 Datathon and Hackathon](https://isca.indiana.edu/publication-research/social-media-project/datathon-2023/index.html) on Antisemitic and hate speech, using NLP and Machine Learning to process social media posts.
- [Language Resources for Turkic Languages](/turkic) - [Focusing on Azerbaijani](/turkic)
- Processing of the Mueller Report: corpus analysis, prediction models, Knowledge Graph and Event Graph extraction, time reference and sequencing along the time axis ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/SemiringInc/Mueller-Report-Corpus)). The cleaned-out text corpus with basic annotations is finally available. More data is coming soon.
- [Antisemitism in Social Media](/antisemitism)
- [I was](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damircavar/) organizing special meetings to refresh our knowledge of Lisp and Prolog for logic computation and reasoning, in particular, related to computational semantics and pragmatics, and probabilistic logic, integrating Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph technologies. See [here](http://damir.cavar.me/2020-01-23-Knowledge_Representation_and_Reasoning_for_AI_using_Lisp_Prolog)... but the pandemic interfered with that. We should talk about a continuation. Please get in touch, if you are interested in Lisp / Scheme / Prolog.


## Notes

In all these projects, we work on hands-on implementation of technologies, utilizing programming languages like [Python] and [Rust], and graph or RDF libraries, as well as common graph-database systems like [Apache Jena], [Fluree], [oxigraph], [AllegroGraph], [GraphDB], or [Neo4j].

See for example:

- [NLP-Lab's Rust material](/rust)
- [NLP-Lab's Python material](/software)

If you are interested in joining our [Rust] tutorials with a focus on using [Rust] for [NLP] and [AI] or in Robotics environments (with the [Robot Operating System] ([ROS])), please get in touch!
